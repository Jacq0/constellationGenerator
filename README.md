# Constellation Generator
I have always had an interest in astronomy and the night sky. In fact we as a species have always been fascinated with the night sky. A constellation is nothing more than a group of stars that people connect and percieve as a certain figure. Despite this they are very interesting, pretty and useful.

Where I live is *very* prone to cloud cover however, so I need a way emulate this from the comfort of my chair! I also just thought it would be a fun little project!

It already looks pretty good, and with so little code! Hoping to improve on it in the future!
