# Constellation Generator
I have always had an interest in astronomy and the night sky. In fact we as a species have always been fascinated with the night sky. A constellation is nothing more than a group of stars that people connect and percieve as a certain figure. Despite this they are very interesting, pretty and useful.

Where I live is *very* prone to cloud cover however, so I need a way emulate this from the comfort of my chair! I also just thought it would be a fun little project!

It already looks pretty good, and with so little code! Hoping to improve on it in the future!

## Update 2

I made the stars individual objects now, this actually improved performance slightly in the generation phase. As you can see the output is a lot more constellation-like but a lot of them are very big and contain intersecting lines, something which real constellations do NOT have. This is still a very basic iteration of the program, but its a lot more flexible than the first. There is also a lack of single star connections, which are really common on actual constellations (because I'm connecting to 2 others now).

I also got this web-like output, and while it looks cool, its not what I'm going for.

Make of it what you will!
